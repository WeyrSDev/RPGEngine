# RPGEngine
RPG engine made with SFML/C++

This was one of the first serious projects I started. I used it to apply the things I learned from the book "Game Coding Complete".
I eventually moved on to other projects, but I try to come back whenever I feel like I've learned something that I can add to the engine.

A few of the features:
 * Entity-component system
 * Event system
 * Collision detection (SAT, AABB)
 * Inventory management
 * WIP Lua scripting support
 * WIP animation support


All artwork is from OpenGameArt.org
 * Tiles - [Kenny] https://opengameart.org/users/kenney
 
Animations were create using [darkFunction Editor](http://darkfunction.com/editor/)

## Requirements
SFML for rendering
