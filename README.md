# RPGEngine
RPG engine made with SFML/C++

This was one of the first serious projects I started. I used it to apply the things I learned from the book "Game Coding Complete".
I eventually moved on to other projects, but I try to come back whenever I feel like I've learned something that I can add to the engine.
